            - Add persistence to business models using SQLAlchemy and a Repository pattern.
                - Write unit tests for Repository and get them to pass.
                - Repeat until enough to get integration test passing.
            - Link Flask with models as needed.
        - Repeat until enough to get E2E test passing.
- Repeat until enough to get user story passing.

Domain model:
- Handle attempts to input logically inconsistent data: raise exception.

Bonus/wish-list domain tasks:
- Track and distinguish publicly-known from non-public information.
- Track and make "probable" deductions based on the fact that a player made a certain suggestion (can't glean any definitive info from this).
- Help recommend the best next suggestion to make to gather the most info possible.
